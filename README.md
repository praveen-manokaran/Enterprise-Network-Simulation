# Enterprise-Network-Simulation
 This project simulates a scalable and secure enterprise-level network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It includes multiple departments connected via VLANs, routing between VLANs, access control lists (ACLs). The simulation demonstrates real-world network design practices for learning, testing, and demonstration purposes.
